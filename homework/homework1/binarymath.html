				<p>Generally when a person does basic arithmetic, they do math in a base of ten.
				<br />Binary numbers, however, are in a <tt>base of two</tt>.  That means that numbers
				<br />are represented by only two digits.  Those two digits are 1's and 0's.
				<br />As a comparison, numbers in a base of ten are represented by ten digits
				<br />(e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
				<br /><br />
				<br />So how does one count in a base of two?  Well lets look at the following table
				<br />to see how numbers are represented in binary:
				</p>
				</div>
<div>				
<table>
				
  <tr>
    <th>NUMBER</th>
    <th>BINARY</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td> 
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>10</td> 
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>11</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>100</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>101</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
			
<p>
	<br />As you can deduce, the first digit represents 1.  The second digit represents 2. 
	<br />The third, 4.  The fourth, 8. And so on.  To better visualize this, look at 
	<br />the above table for the number five, which is represented in binary as 101. 
    <br />We would look at the three digits and see 4 + 0 + 1 = 5.  Let's take the binary
    <br />number 7, this would be represented by forming digits that represent 4 + 2 + 1.  
    <br />Thus the answer is 111 in binary.  And the number 6 would be 110, or 4+2+0 = 6.  
    <br /><br />Now that you have learned basic binary math, you are ready to learn how binary
    <br />math is used in computing by continuing on to...
