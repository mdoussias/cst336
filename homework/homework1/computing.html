				<br />An interesting applicaiton of binary math is in <tt>classical computing</tt>.   Computers
				<br />use binary numbers as the basis of all their calculations.  This allows computers
				<br />to be a useful tool to people. 
				<br />The reason for this is that at the base of a computer, it functions as an electronic 
				<br />device.  As electrical current can be harnessed most easily as on or off, this lends itself 
				<br />to using a binary system of numerical representation. 1's represent on, and 0's 
				<br />represent off.  Now the user of a computer sees colorful images, hears articulate 
				<br />sounds, and is able to interact with a variety of data and text.  But again, all
				<br />if you could look deep under the hood of a computer, you would be able to see that
				<br />all you do on a computer is made possible by binary calculations.	
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<br />Furthermore, in computing, data is often handled with a certain number of bits.  This would be the 
				<br />amount of places used. For instance:
				</p>
				
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>2 bits is represented by one digit:  1 or 0</li>
				<li>4 bits is represented by two digits: 11, 00, 10, or 01</li>
				<li>8 bits is represented by three digits: 000, 001, 010, 011, ... and so forth</li>
				</ul>		
				<p>
				As you can see, binary numbers are able to represent 2<sup>Nth</sup>, where N is the number of digits.
				<br />
				<br />Now that you have learned a bit about bits, you are ready for...
